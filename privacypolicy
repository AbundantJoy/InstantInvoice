Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Instant Invoice ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our Invoice Generator mobile application ("App") on iOS devices. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not use the App.

Information We Collect

We do not collect any data from App users. All information you input into the App to generate invoices, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, billing information, or invoice details (e.g., descriptions of goods or services, amounts, and dates), is stored locally on your iOS device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.

No Collection of Data





No Personal Information: We do not collect or store any personal information, such as your name, email address, or contact details.



No Usage Data: We do not collect information about how you interact with the App, such as usage statistics or device information.



No Analytics Data: We do not use third-party analytics tools to track or analyze App usage.

All data you input for invoice generation is stored exclusively on your device and is not accessed, collected, or stored by us.

How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any data, we do not use your information for any purpose. All invoice-related data is processed and stored locally on your device to generate invoices based on your input.

How We Share Your Information

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or usage data. Since all data is stored locally on your device, no information is shared with third parties, including service providers, unless you explicitly choose to share generated invoices (e.g., via email or other apps).

Data Storage and Security

All data you input into the App is stored locally on your iOS device. We do not store, access, or transmit this data. We implement reasonable measures to ensure the App’s functionality is secure, but you are responsible for the security of your device and any data stored on it.

No method of storage is completely secure. While we strive to provide a secure App, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data stored on your device.

Data Retention

Since we do not collect or store any data, there is no data retention by us. Data you input for invoice generation is stored locally on your device and may be included in device backups (e.g., via iCloud) if you enable such features. You can delete your data from the App at any time by removing generated invoices or uninstalling the App.

Third-Party Services

The App may allow you to use iOS features, such as iCloud for backups or sharing invoices via email or other apps. These services are provided by Apple or other third parties and have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services.

Your Choices

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your information:





Access and Update: You can review and update the information you input into the App at any time.



Delete Data: You can delete invoices or other data stored in the App by using the App’s delete functionality or uninstalling the App.



Backups: If you use iCloud or other backup services, your data may be included in those backups. You can manage these backups through your device settings.

Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since all data is stored locally on your device, no data from children is collected by us.

International Users

The App is operated in [Your Country/Region]. All data is stored locally on your device, and no data is transferred to us or processed outside your device, regardless of your location.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy in the App or by other means, such as email. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
